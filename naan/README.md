# 📋 Sample Prompt
what is genarative ai

# 📋 Sample Output


Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as images, music, text, or even 3D models. Unlike traditional AI models that primarily learn from data and make predictions or decisions, generative AI learns patterns from input data and uses them to generate novel, often human-like, outputs.

Key characteristics of generative AI include:

1. **Content Creation:** It generates new content that wasn't explicitly present in the training data. For instance, a text generator might produce a story that doesn't exist in any provided text corpus.

2. **Learning from Examples:** Generative models learn the underlying structure of data by examining examples. This can involve statistical analysis, deep learning, or other complex methods.

3. **Variability and Diversity:** These models aim to produce outputs with a high degree of variety and unpredictability,etc.
